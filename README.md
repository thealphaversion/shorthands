## why?

I came across this tweet by

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When onboarding new team members, please define acronyms.<br>Spoiler alert: we have no idea what they mean and we&#39;re often too anxious to speak up (especially in a group setting).</p>&mdash; Emma Bostian 🐞 (@EmmaBostian) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1293093657336336384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2020</a></blockquote>

and this reply to the tweet

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I see this happen way too much. An engineer on my team actually created a web app for the company called IDK where you can search terms. He did that when he first started!</p>&mdash; Ryan Burgess (@burgessdryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/burgessdryan/status/1293225318002515969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2020</a></blockquote>

and I thought that a solution to this could be helpful to people and it's a good way for me to practice.
